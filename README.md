# Danny-s-Dinner-SQL-CASE-STUDY
This case study explores customer purchasing behavior at a restaurant through various SQL queries. The analysis is based on data from three tables: sales, menu, and members. The study covers customer spending habits, frequency of visits, first and most popular items purchased, and their points earned through a loyalty program.
